During the Data Science course, I used a dataset containing information about medicinal drug usage and satisfaction. 
The dataset contained information about the drug effectiveness, user satisfaction and ease of use. For my own project, 
I conducted various analyses on this dataset, which included a univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis.
A Machine Learning model in that project was used to investigate the influences of ease of use and effectiveness on drug satisfaction.
It was found that these elements did indeed influence drug satisfaction, but the results were not convincing enough
to say this is the case for every drug and/or situation; therefore, it was concluded that perhaps more 
investigation would need to take place.
